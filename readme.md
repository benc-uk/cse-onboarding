# CSE Technical Onboarding - Crew Exercise

This repo contains instructions, guidance and details of a exercise intended to get new starters in CSE familiar with several aspects of how we work, the technology we use and how we approach a project engagement. It is closely aligned to the [CSE Engineering Fundamentals](https://microsoft.github.io/code-with-engineering-playbook/) which is a playbook that provides both specific technical advice and general high level guidance on what good looks like to CSE.

## Anticipated Outcomes and Activities

- Plan & execute work, in an agile fashion similar to a .
- DevOps; infrastructure as code, CI/CD, release automation.
- Solution design, architecture choices
- Write some code!
- Learn to work with Azure and range of services, SDKs etc.

## Outline

This exercise should be done as a team, ideally as a whole crew; with the dev lead, engineers and TPM all working together as they would on a real customer engagement. The length of time you spend should be agreed upfront but 2~4 weeks is a recommendation.

The following is intended as a high level guideline to provide some structure to the exercise, but kept deliberately open ended should. Agree upfront as a group on your approach.

- Create project in AzDo or GitHub to track work and hold code, docs, wiki etc.
- Decide on where and how you will collaborate, e.g. Teams
- Carry out a mock "mini" ADS, the dev lead will likely run this with you, based on one of the provided scenarios below.
- Build high level design, solutioning, architecture/service choices, and diagrams etc.
- Build backlog
  - Focus on spikes and investigations where there is ambiguity, include them in backlog/board
- Use a trunk based development & version control flow, using CI and PRs. The **main** branch should always be shippable and functional.


## Customer Scenario

Currently one scenario is provided, more to be added later:
  
- [Iommi Corp - Modernized Customer Experience](scenarios/iommi-corp/readme.md)
